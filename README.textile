h2. A www.grocerygadgets.com client in Ruby.

h3. Designed for use on a thin client PC, 20x2 LCD Screen and USB barcode scanner.

When the milk is about to run out or trash goes in the bin,
just scan the barcode and it's added to an online shopping list at grocerygadgets.com.
You can type in an item manually, too.
The shopping list is then automatically synced to all of your flatmate's mobile devices using
the grocery gadgets iPhone or Android app.

Is it actually useful? We'll see... But at least it's helped me learn a bit more about UI design on a 20x2 LCD.
